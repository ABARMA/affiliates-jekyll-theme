Podcasts are a great opportunity both for individuals to build a personal brand, and for businesses to acquire customers organically. Audio search is the new growing trend, and just as blogs are crucial for traffic generation, podcasts will drive organic growth. It is therefore crucial to find your niche so that you can create an interesting podcast series that provides consistent valuable content for the audience who tune in for your episodes.

<h2>How to find your niche?</h2>

Finding a niche that has a potential to succeed ultimately boils down to selecting a valuable podcast idea.

<h3><a name="0"> Throw away ideas </a></h3>

Let me ask you a question. What’s the first idea that occurred to you? 

If your answer entails content related to your product, or interviewing your customers, then you need to throw it away. Why? Because it doesn’t constitue interesting content for anyone. Customers of your product are likely to have very diverse interests, and you may not be able to generate interest amongst anyone in such a case. 

Even if your answer was any different, play the devil's advocate and try to poke as many holes into it as possible. It's always better to evaluate upfront as to why things may not work and steer in the right direction. Finding your niche requires groundwork and the following steps can be a good place to start. 

<h3><a name="1"> Define your audience </a></h3>

Traditional marketing makes us think from a funnels perspective. The focus lies on driving in a large group of people (i.e. traffic) to the site through valuable content delivery, and conversion maximization of those people into customers of the product you offer.  This surely works for blogs, newsletters or other written long-form content formats. However, for organic growth through audio content i.e. podcasts, the key is word of mouth referrals within a community of people. 

To gain Word of Mouth growth, you must visualize concentric circles instead of funnels, and focus on starting small. 

What does that mean?

Starting small implies focussing on the innermost circle, which usually comprise a group of individuals who communicate regularly about shared interests. These could be individuals belonging to a subculture, having meetup groups, or participants of different communities. 

<h4>How to find your niche audience?</h4>
  
Leveraging existing platforms are a great place to get a headstart. Groups of people sharing similar interests are already on these platforms. A good strategy entails the following steps: 

<ol><li> <b>Get involved</b> in groups that fall under the broader category that you plan to talk about </li>
<li> <b>Analyze discussions/questions</b> people talk about</li>
<li> <b>Write down specifics</b> to detail out your plan</li>
</ol>

Some of the platforms to consider: 

<ul><li>Reddit</li>
<li>Slack communities</li>
<li> Discord chats </li>
<li> Meetup events </li>
<li> Quora/Twitter spaces</li>
<li> Telegram groups </li>
<br/>
Additionally, some cool new ways of discovery include:

<li><a href="https://sparktoro.com" target="_blank">Sparktoro</a> – A free tool to discover other topics that a community might be interested in</li>
<li>Hashtags on social media to give an idea of what’s trending and what gets people excited</li>
</ul>

Spending some time in the process should help you lock down on your target audience. Once you have found your niche audience, read below to learn what you should do next. 

<h3><a name="2">Use insights to drive strategy</a></h3>

Put on your critical thinking hat and think about this
<ul>
<li>What does my audience desire?</li>
<li>What is the outcome they expect to achieve?</li>
<li>What are the barriers between their desire and outcome?</li>
</ul>

Identifying barriers between desire and outcome often help in narrowing down on the value that you can provide to your audience through a series of podcast episodes. The question then becomes...

<h4>How to come up with actionable insights?</h4>

Some common ways to address these concerns are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Leverage search data</li>
<li>Have conversations with community members (Just reach out. Someone is always ready to help. Trust me!)</li> 
<li>Conduct focus groups (if you have capital)</li>
<li>Research social interactions and list down your observations</li>
<li>Send out surveys</li>
</ul>

At this point, an idea should begin to emerge. What you'll need to consider next are different possibilities of execution. 

<h3><a name="3"> Turn insight into execution</a> </h3>

Insight generation should have given you a broad idea of where you would like to head. To get into execution mode of the idea, it's important to detail out the specifics of the show. In order to do this, it generally helps to take inspiration from other existing content formats on TV or radio shows

<h4> How to get inspiration without copying? </h4>

Let's take a few examples to learn how to get inspiration: 

<b>Example 1:</b> You're a marketing agency - You can recreate Queer Eye for marketing of startup's products or services. 
<br/><b>Example 2:</b> You want to create a talk show. You could recreate the following:
<ul><li> Ellen Show - Have multiple interviews with fun segments in between</li>
<li>The Tonight Show - Mix of monologue, interviews and sketches etc. </li></ul>

The point is, even a talk show could have diffirent executions strategies. Reimagine what suits you best, and plan out execution accordingly.  


<h3>Finding a podcast niche</h3>

To summarize, finding your niche for consistent content delivery requires a strategic process which entails you to
<ol><li><a href="#0">Discard a few top of the mind ideas (basically to make you question and think deeper)</a></li>
<li><a href="#1">Define an audience for your podcast</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Generate insights from your target audience</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Convert insights into actionable steps</a></li>
</ol>

These steps should help you identify the niche you want to operate in as well as come up with a strategy to get started.
