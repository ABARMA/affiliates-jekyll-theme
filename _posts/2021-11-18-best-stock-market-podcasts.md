<p>As a beginner investor you may have a ton of questions about the stock market including how stock market works, when stock markets open, why stock market is failing and so on. Getting answers from the right sources is critical to help you move in the right direction. Although there are several resources out there, they can sometimes be overwhelming and finding one that is easy to understand can be tricky. Believe me, I've been there! </p>

<p> The great thing about podcasts is the range of topics. You could be listening to a podcast about dragons one day and one about stock market the next!</p>
