#### Step 1: Define Your Product 

<p>Before starting out, most of us have a brief idea about what type of content we wish to create. When thinking of creative names, I start off by listing down a few things. I'm sure following this will be useful for you as well. Here's what you can do:
<ul><li>Define the core value that you plan to offer through your podcast content</li>
<li>List down words that capture your overall podcast idea well enough</li>
<li>Research keywords or phrases relevant to your podcast category or industry</li>
<li>Create a tone or personality for the podcast </li></ul>
For example, if your content is more casual, think about adding funny or quirky names to the list, whereas, if your content is for business purposes, add podcast names that highlight the business category or value offered in your podcast</p>

#### Step 2: Define Your Target Audience

<p>Once you have the laundry list of ideas for podcast names, it's important to shortlist the most suitable and creative podcast names by keeping your target audience in mind.</p>

<p><b> How to define your target audience?</b></p>
<p> Target audience can be segmented based on thw following:
<ul><li>Demographics:- Age, Gender, Income Potential, Location </li>
<li>Psychographics: Interests, Activities, Opinions</li>
<li>Culture: Communities of people who share common experiences</li>
</ul>

While defining your target audience, it is good practice to define who your target audience is not. This often helps in getting a clearer picture.</p>

#### Step 3: Optimize for Search Engines

<p> With more and more podcasts being created and published, podcast discovery has been a challenge creators grapple with. </p>
<p> To make it easier for you, what would help is finding names that not only pique the interest of your target audience, but also contain attractive keywords for google's search algorithm. You want clever podcast names that are also easily findable online. </p>
<p> It all comes down to taking all the help you can get by leveraging google's algorithm to your advantage. </p>

#### Step 4: Perform Sanity Check 

<p>Basic sanity checks such as checking for availability and looking to avoid duplicates is essential. In the US especially, trademark rights go to the first person to use that mark for similar goods or services. This means thatif someone has already used a podcast name you're considering, he/she will have superior legal rights for that name. </p>

<h5>How to check if your podcast name is taken? </h5>

<ol><li>Search your podcast name in common podcast directories. Browse through Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts etc. to see if anything similar shows up. </li>
<li>Perform a quick check on availability of twitter, instagram and pinterest handles</li>
<li>Leverage tools like <a href="namechk.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">namechk.com</a> which searches over 100 services to check if the name is taken.</li>
<li>Lastly, search for availability of domain URLs that can go along with your podcast show.</li>
</ol>

#### Step 5: Test it to Collect Feedback 

<p>Now that your background work is complete, and you have all the check boxes tick marked, it's time to test it out with your target audience to collect real-world feedback. </p> 

<p>Reach out to people who fit your target segment, and ask them things like: 
<ul><li>Did the podcast name resonate with them? If so, why? </li>
<li>Did the name clearly communicate what your podcast is about?</li>
<li>Did it intrigue them enough to make them want to find out more? </li>
<li>What did they like or dislike about the name?</li>
<li>Was it easy enough for them to remember? - This helps check if your podcast could grow through word of mouth recommendations </li>
<li> and so on. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>How to Register a Podcast Name</h3>

<p>Once you've undergone this process and have finally selected a unique, clever podcast name, you may want to consider registering for trademarking the name. </p>
<p> Registration provides benefits such as an insurance of having benefit of doubt in case of a legal conflict. The registration process, however, is tricky and seeking help from a trademark attorney might help in this regard.
