## Big Marketing Money is Flowing into Podcasting

You may have noticed hoarding boards promoting podcasts on the streets of India. In fact, there’s a distinct podcast section on most music listening apps these days. The reason? Future is Audio!  

Most podcast streaming apps are spending massive amounts of money on their marketing budget in educating the audience about this medium of content delivery. They are also creating original podcasts that unique to their platform to build loyal listeners. This provides a paid collaboration opportunity to some good podcast creators. 

The marketing by big companies, along with changing consumer behaviour towards audio is leading to adoption of podcasting among the masses. It's a great market to leverage right now!

## Top Celebrities and YouTube Creators are Getting into Podcasting

Back in 2017, one could literally count the number of podcasters on the fingertips. But now, even Amitabh Bachchan is creating a podcast, and top creators on Instagram and YouTube are jumping onto podcasting.

India has grown to become the 3rd largest podcasting market in the world. Think about the opportunity that exists, and how big it can get in the near future. 

## High Audience Retention Time

Have you ever considered how watching or reading is a primary activity? It is the reason why you might watch a video for 5-10 minutes, or read a blog in 2-3 minutes. However, listening is a secondary activity and you can listen to audio while driving, cooking, jogging or working out. 

This is why podcast listeners are able to spend 30 minutes on average listening their favourite episodes. That's amazing retention time for any creator if you ask me.

Podcasting is your medium if you’d like deeper engagement with your audience!

## Regional Language Podcasts are going Mainstream

Spotify reported a 1100% growth in Hindi podcasts since last year. Similar growth is likely to happen this year in other regional languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Bangla and so on. 

When a lot of regional language creators adopt this medium, podcasting is likely to explode in India. There will be tremendous early mover advantage for great content creators.
