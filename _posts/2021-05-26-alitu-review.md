#### <a name="11">Why is Alitu Good for Beginner Podcasters</a>
<p>On interacting with many podcasters, I've found that the process on content creation for podcasting itself can be fairly daunting and time-consuming. Majority of podcasters mentioned that editing and publishing added more complexity to their podcast creation process. And some of them didn't enjoy doing it at all.</p>
<p> Most beginner podcasters felt most productive while creating valuable content rather than spending time learning complex editing and publishing processes. This left them with 2 options. They could either: 
<ol><li>Hire an intern/freelancer for editing episodes, or</li>
<li>Use a podcast maker app that provides useful, easy-to-use features</li>
</ol></p>
<p>I did some research and came across Alitu - The Podcast Maker App. Although a small player compared to its bigger competitors such as Anchor, I feel Alitu does a great job in simplifying the technical complexities that might overburden a podcasting beginner. As podcasters themselves, Alitu founders understand the needs of podcasters and are building easy-to-use drag & drop features on an intuitive user interface.

#### <a name="13">How to Use Alitu</a> 

Let's take a look at the steps you need to take as a podcast creator, and how Alitu can help in each of step of your creation process. 

<h5><a name="1"> Step 1: Record your Content </a></h5>

You can record solo as well as invite a guest for a remote call recording right inside the Alitu app. It is the newest feature launched for creators. You get an option to send a call recording link to your partner or guest, so that your recording is directly saved into the library for further use. Here's what you need to do in order to record an episode:

<ul><li>Record a Call</li>
<li>Share the invite link with your partner/guest</li>
<li>At the scheduled time, drop in and record</li>
<li>When done, end call and let Alitu get to work</li>
</ul>

In case you don't want to record within Alitu, you have an alternative options to simply upload an episode.

<h5> <a name="2">Step 2: Initiate Episode Creation </a></h5>

<p>Once you have your episode content ready, go to 'Episodes', and click on 'Add an Episode' to fill in the episode details. <b>Episode details</b> primarily capture ID3 tags data.</p>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/alitu/episode-details.png" alt="alitu episode details">
<p><b>What is ID3 tag?</b></p>
<p>ID3 tag is a type of metadata container that is used to store information onto a media file. </p>
<p>Make sure you fill up your episode's metadata information correctly, as it is carried over to your podcast hosting platform and allows players to use the ID3 data ahead of streaming time without downloading the full podcast file.
</p>
Upon saving episode details, you have 3 options: 
<ol><li><b>Upload a pre-recorded file from your computer</b></li>
<p>If you've already recorded your podcast using a different app, you can upload the file to access it in Alitu's library
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/alitu/upload-episode.png" alt="upload episode"></p>
<li><b>Upload your clip from Alitu library</b></li>
<p>Click on Add Recording, and select the library option to select your clip from the Alitu library
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/alitu/upload-from-alitu-library.png" alt="upload from alitu library"></p>
<li><b>Record your clip in Alitu</b></li>
<p>After clicking on Add Recording, you also have the option to record directly inside the Alitu app

<p><b>Merging clips - Alitu's greatest benefit</b></p>
<p>As long as clips are in sync by time and of the same length, Alitu can clean it up and merge them together for you. It really is that simple. To merge the clips you have uploaded, just click on the link icon highlighted below.</p>

<h5><a name="3"> Step 3: Add finishing touches to your Episode</a></h5>
<p> Your episode seems incomplete without intro/outro clips, theme music and advert segments (if you have sponsored episodes). Therefore, adding finishing touches is crucial before publishing your episode. To add the best finishing touch, Alitu has a <b>royalty-free music library </b>that gives creators an opportunity to be creative by adding voiceovers, transition clips etc. </p>

<p> Alitu's episode builder provides flexibility to add theme music and a fade from music to voice. You can edit the music length, fade length, as well as rearrange your clips. Here's how it's done. </p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/alitu/episode-builder.png" alt="episode builder"></p>

<h5> <a name="4">Step 4: Edit your Episode </a></h5>
<p>You can easily click play on the clips to find sections that need to be edited out. Zoom in and cut out silences at the start and end of each clip, as well as any big mistakes or noises within a recording etc.
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/alitu/edit-a-clip.png" alt="edit alitu clip"></p>
To finish up, click â€˜Save all Edits' and head back to the episode builder.
</p>

<h5> <a name="5">Step 5: Publish your Episode </a></h5>

Alitu has made podcast publishing super simple. Here's what you must do. 

<ol><li><b>Set up Podcast Hosting</b></li>

<p>When it's your first time on Alitu, I suggest that you link your hosting service to streamline your publishing process in the future. </p>
