<p> Podcasting offers tremendous value to listeners in several areas such as business, entrepreneurship, education, psychology, technology etc. Learning English with podcasts is one of them.</p> 

### How to Learn English with Podcast?

<p> Research suggests that listening has an important place in language acquisition. The sound, rhythm, intonation and stress of the language can only be perfectly adopted through listening. Since listening forms the concrete basis for complete language proficiency, as per research, podcasts have a lot to offer in this scenario. English language podcasts are a great way to learn English fluently.</p> 

<p>If you're interested in reading more about the underlying research, you can check it out <a href="https://www.ripublication.com/ijeisv1n1/ijeisv4n1_13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

#### Learn English Speaking Easily

<p> Before we start. I want to be honest with you! </p>

<p>I have a tendency to lose focus and miss out on parts of the content when I listen to podcasts while doing other activities such as cooking or driving. Many a times I end up rewinding few minutes of the episodes due to loss of context.</p>
<p>If you are like me, and you're interested in using podcast for english learning, losing focus can become a disadvantage. Learning english by podcasts will require an active listening approach. Therefore, acknowledging some of your own listening barriers can be a good way to create an optimal environment that helps you effectively listen and learn english by podcasts for free. </p>

<p> I want to help you start the process of finding your barriers to effective listening by listing down some of the common issues faced by english learning beginners. My hope is that this helps you find yours!</p>

#### Barriers for Effective Listening

Some of the main reasons why learners find difficulty in listening are the following:

<ul><li>Lack of effort to understand every word while listening</li>
<li>Laziness to build up vocabulary gradually over time</li>
<li>Difficulties with accent and pronunciation</li>
<li>Low concentration power</li>
<li>Distraction due to physical or environmental settings</li>
</ul>

#### How to Overcome Barriers for Effective Listening

Learning english with podcasts undoubtedly requires effective listening. Few minutes of lost focus can lead to loss of context. Therefore, planning few strategies to help out is an approach to consider. Here are some that have worked for me and other podcast listeners. 

<ul>
<b><li>Create the right environment </li></b>
A quiet room with pen and paper to jot down notes can go a long way. Getting rid of distractions and concentrating on the content is important while trying to learn something new. So plan and set up a nice and quite environment to get started. 
<b><li>Listen & Summarize </li></b>
Listening to the main idea and summarizing helps in understanding the context to improve comprehension. It is also a good idea to create a list for all the new vocabulary you come across. Doing so not only improves retention but also provides you notes that you can revisit for better learning.  
<b><li>Slow it down</li></b>
Most podcast apps have the option to slow down the speedof streaming. You should consider using this in case you have difficulty in following the accent or pronunciation.
<b><li>Review Show Notes</li></b>
Podcast creators usually upload show notes or transcripts on their podcast websites, and link to it is easily available in the episode description in most cases. This means that you can listen and read at the same time, which can double your speed of learning english easily.
</ul>
<p>I consistently practice these points, especially the top 2, and I've observed significant improvement in content retention. I suggest you give these a try and notice the change soon.</p>

<p>Now that you have this under control, let's look at the best podcasts to learn english language.</p>
